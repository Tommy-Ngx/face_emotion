This is also working to boyfriends and any friends! ! !

This is a small application for expression classification built using Tensorflow.js and Angular.

## Run

First of all you need to have `angular-cli`. The method of running locally is to cd to the project directory, run `ng serve`, and then visit `localhost:4200/` in the browser.

## Bale

Run `ng build` to build the project directly. This will generate the target website in the `dist/` directory. Add the `--prod` tag to build the page for deployment.

## How to play

The gameplay is very simple. If your computer has a camera, click "Turn on the camera" and you can see the image captured by the camera. Click the middle category, you can input the corresponding image. After the training is completed, the camera will analyze the image in real time and give the maximum category probability. You can ask your girlfriend to record a few pictures, and the next time your girlfriend puts on this expression, she will know what she is thinking! ! !
